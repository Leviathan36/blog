## Coverage Tests

Measuring **code coverage** is a fundamental practice in software development to understand what percentage of your source code is actually executed by your test suite. It doesn't guarantee that the code is correct, but it helps you identify untested parts.

The standard tool in Python for this is `coverage.py`, which integrates perfectly with `pytest` via the `pytest-cov` plugin.

Here's how to do it:

**1. Basic Concept: What is Code Coverage?**

Coverage measures how many executable "parts" of your code are activated during test execution. These "parts" can be:

  - **Line coverage:** has every executable line of code been run at least once?
  - **Branch coverage:** has every possible branch in control structures (e.g., `if`/`else`, `try`/`except`) been taken? (More comprehensive than line coverage).

The goal is usually to aim for high coverage (often 80-90% or more), but 100% is not always necessary or practical and, I repeat, does not guarantee the absence of bugs. It's more important to test critical logic well.

**2. Installing the Tools**

You'll need `pytest` and the `pytest-cov` plugin. Install them via `pip` in your virtual environment:

```bash
pip install pytest pytest-cov
```

`pytest-cov` also takes care of installing `coverage.py` as a dependency if it's not already present.

The easiest way to run coverage tests is using `pytest`. Just add the `--cov` option to your normal `pytest` command.

You can set the main settings for pytest coverage in the `.coveragerc` file:

```ini
[run]
branch = true       # Always enable branch coverage testing
source =
    app             # Specify here the modules to measure (alternative to --cov)
omit =
    */tests/* # Exclude files in the tests folder
    */__main__.py   # Exclude any __main__ scripts
    */migrations/* # Exclude migrations (if using an ORM)
    */venv/* # Exclude the virtual environment

[report]
show_missing = true       # Always show missing lines in the terminal report
fail_under = 40           # Fail the execution (exit code != 0) if total coverage is < 40%
exclude_lines =
    pragma: no cover      # Do not consider lines with this comment
    def __repr__          # Exclude __repr__ definitions
    if __name__ == .__main__.: # Exclude the standard main block
    # Python 3.7+ type hint guard
    if typing.TYPE_CHECKING:
    # Abstract methods
    @(abc\.)?abstractmethod

[html]
directory = coverage_html_report # Change the name of the HTML report folder
```

(Note: Added common `exclude_lines` for `typing.TYPE_CHECKING` and abstract methods to the `.coveragerc` example)

Pytest-cov also allows saving in JSON format for future processing.
